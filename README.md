# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## The Overview of the project:

- Pewlett Hackard (P&H)is a large company which will have thousands of employees meeting the retirement criteria. The company is preparing this baby boomer retirement in two ways. First, they are offering retirement package for eligible employees who will be retired soon. Second, they will start fulfilling the vacancies after those retirees leaving the company.

- We are helping Bobby, an up and coming HR Analyst to do the employee research. We will use SQL language, ERD and pdAdmin tool to generate lists of number and department of Pewlett Hackard employees who will be leaving soon and help the manager prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami" with the mentorship eligibility program.s


## Result & :

- A total number of 72,458 current employees, who were born between 1952-01-01 to 1955-12-31, will be retired soon.
- Breakdown number of employees by their most recent job title who are about to retire

- For the mentorship program that the company plans to implement, only 1,549 employees are eligible to be the mentor if we set the criteria that mentors need to be born between 1965-01-01 and 1965-12-31.
- For 1549 mentors, there will be 72458 total new hires, meaning that each mentor need to take almost 47 mentees. The burden for each mentor would be too high.

## Summary & Suggestions:
- It's not enough to have only 1549 mentors for 72458 new hire/replacement. P&H needs to increase their mentor groups.
- From the screenshot below, we can see that if we
